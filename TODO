Evaluation Improvements
    Midgame, Early Game
        Mobility
        Attacks

Rust Full Rewrite

Incremental updates
    - king safety
    - mobility
    - attacks
        - pins
    - defends
    - static exchange evaluation

Stateful searches
    - Zobrist hashing for incremental hash updates
        - to be used keys in transposition tables
        - Killer Heuristic https://www.chessprogramming.org/Killer_Heuristic

Iterative Deepening
    - Requires Above to be Useful

Self tuned evaluation coefficients, or trained neural net for evaluation and move ordering
    - Reinforcement Learning?

    - Genetic Refinement?
        - Fitness search
            - Basic:
                Do a tournament, take top 10% permute them and use that as basis for the next gen
            - Correct imbalance selection
                Of those most fit, find matches in which they lost, label opponent lost to as Underdog
                    Find Underdog's opponents, of the most fit of those, combine with original subject

        - Novelty search

    - Gradient Descent

    "exploration" vs. "exploitation" 2:1 ? maybe tuned ratio depending on plateau or not, plateau -> more exploration, breakthrough -> more exploitation
    Curiosity training, seeing different results = success
