Evaluation Improvements
    Midgame, Early Game
        Mobility
        Attacks

Incremental updates
    - king safety
    - mobility
    - attacks
        - pins
    - defends
    - static exchange evaluation

Stateful searches
    - Zobrist hashing for incremental hash updates
        - to be used keys in transposition tables
        - Killer Heuristic https://www.chessprogramming.org/Killer_Heuristic

Iterative Deepening
    - Requires Above to be Useful

Self tuned evaluation coefficients, or trained neural net for evaluation and move ordering
    - Reinforcement Learning?

    - Genetic Refinement?
        - Fitness search
        - Novelty search

    - Gradient Descent

    "exploration" vs. "exploitation" 2:1 ? maybe tuned ratio depending on plateau or not, plateau -> more exploration, breakthrough -> more exploitation
